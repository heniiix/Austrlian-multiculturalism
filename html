Mainly, in European countries which recognize the ethno-cultural. Moreover, the German, French, British, Dutch and some other European leaders appear to have one thing in common; when they use the multiculturalism word, they actually mean Islamic culture.

It assumes that culture is enriched by diversity rather than polluted by it and that the diverse cultural elements exist within a cultural envelope that creates its own common ground.

It usually consists of a complex set of agreed national values and goals, normative and structural systems as well as policy, budgetary and program responses put in place to manage diversity. Multiculturalism in this sense is recognized in countries such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia. (Western Sydney University, 2015)</p>

Prior to permanent European settlement in 1788 there were many different indigenous cultures. Most people who came to Australia in the 18th and 19th centuries were from the British Isles, there were others from a variety of backgrounds. The gold rush of the 1850s attracted people from all over the world.
                                                               Since World War II, approximately 6 million immigrants from over 150 countries are settled in Australia (Members of the National Multicultural Advisory Council, 1997). Today, around 41 per cent of people living in Australia were born overseas or have a parent born overseas. These percentages are among the highest in the developed world. Collectively, there are approximately 260 languages spoken in Australia. (The Australian Collaboration, 2013).</p>
